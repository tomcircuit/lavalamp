Status of prototype:

PCB received 1/8/2023
PCB assembled 1/16/2023

Observations: 
pads for Micro USB were easy enough to work with
might want to put a hole in pads beneath USB shield body to allow soldering from backside.
including a JST connector for 5V would make power wiring easier when USB not needed

Arduino test code 1/16/2023 (Arduino IDE)
upload via CH340 USB bridge and reset circuit works
SK9822 LED array works

Arduino test code 1/17/2023 (PlatformIO)
sometimes upload of a running target is a bit tricky/erratic and needs manual reset
